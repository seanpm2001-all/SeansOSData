<p>I am officially turning this into a long-term multi-use project now. What all started with me finding a way to backup my current phone to the next one has turned into a big database of device info throughout my life.</p>
<p>Prominent changes that occurred today were the introduction of the update log and developer log, and a new iOS page. I will start adding in other machines and operating systems soon.</p>

<p>This project has taken a turn today, and now I have introduced a universe and galaxy system. 9 branches of devices have been listed, the one that I started out with is now considered the Samsung Galaxy (a pun of the Samsung Galaxy line of phones)</p>
<p>There is now a structured directory system, with lots of device info. It is taking me some time to add in all the icons, and some of them are hard to find. A lot of things can still be done.</p>

<p>Today I improved the data of the other devices, and did massive amounts of data updates. I am starting to take a break from site development in favor of this project for a change.</p>
<p>I will get back to SNU, I am just enjoying something different for a bit. This project is going along great, there is so much data, and it looks really good now. I still want to make it more efficient however.</p>

<p>Today I have signaled the change of just a transfer project to a databse by renaming the file, and making many improvements. The massive change that happened today was the addin of data other than the S7 edge, now containing sections for all 5 of my Android-based phones I have had.</p>
<p>Other changes were made today as well, but they weren't as significant as the latter.</p>

<p>Some more changes were made today, I have been able to keep development on this project going on a daily basis. I am taking more of a break from SNU for this project. I am still deciding if SNU and this project should ever merge.</p>
<p>The HTML5 version reached version 5 today, with several new changes to improve the database. It now goes beyond the concept of transferring from one phone to another, and that change will happen tomorrow.</p>

<p>I made a significant change to the Android project today by porting the text file into a separate HTML5 version. It now has a lot more capabilities, such as images, and styling. The project is going to improve from here.</p>
<p>Many changes were made today, and I made an update over double the size of the work in the past 2 days.</p>

<p>I added a little bit more data to the project today, development of the project is becoming addicting. I am planning a big upgrade to the project for tomorrow.</p>
<p>There is a lot of data, almost more than enough now, it is just a genuinely fun project to work on.</p>

<p>Today, I created an advanced text file listing info of backing up my current phone (Samsung Galaxy S7 edge) to my next phone, as my phone is getting old. Surprisingly, I was able to add in a lot of data this time, as this wasn't the first time I tried doing this.</p>
<p>This time, the process became successful. It is only a text file for now, but it contains almost all the data I need to backup to my next device. Changes were made later that evening that brought more progress to the project.</p>
